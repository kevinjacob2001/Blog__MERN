      <h1>Hello, welcome to my travel blog</h1>
      <p>
      Travel blogging is a popular niche. If you are looking to create your own WordPress travel website, this can play to your favor, as there are so many travel blogs to gather inspiration from.
In this article, we will look at a number of travel blogs (in no particular order) created with MERN stack. Hopefully, these sites will help inspire the design, layout, navigation, pages, images, sidebars, widgets, and many other aesthetics and features, of your own travel blog. So let’s get started…

          South Pacific islands
        Shaped like a giant sombrero, this lush volcanic island stars in
        countless South Pacific fantasies. The focal point and best asset of
        this tropical beauty is its ravishing lagoon in technicolor turquoise.
        Fish, turtles, sharks, and rays swim in the clear waters, and tiny
        islets or motus dot the lagoon. The island, of course, is distinctly
        French, with mouthwatering cuisine to match. Diving and snorkeling are
        excellent in the surrounding reefs, and hiking trails weave through the
        palm-studded forests.
